# Recipe Manager Exercise

Welcome to my Recipe Manager Exercise! This project consists of two Python scripts: `recipe_input.py` and `recipe_search.py`. These scripts allow you to store recipes and their ingredients in a binary file and search for recipes by ingredient.

## Part 1: `recipe_input.py`

### How to Use `recipe_input.py`

1. **Run the Script**: To start, run the script in your terminal:
    ```sh
    python recipe_input.py
    ```
2. **Enter the Filename**: You'll be prompted to enter a filename to store your recipes (e.g., `recipes.dat`).
3. **Enter the Number of Recipes**: Specify how many recipes you want to add.
4. **Enter Recipe Details**: For each recipe, provide the recipe name, cooking time (in minutes), and ingredients (separated by commas).
5. **Save Recipes**: The script will save the recipes and their ingredients in the specified binary file.

### Example Run
```
Enter the filename to store the recipes: recipes.dat
How many recipes would you like to enter? 2
Enter the recipe name: Pasta
Enter the cooking time (in minutes): 15
Enter the ingredients (separated by commas): pasta, tomato sauce, cheese
Enter the recipe name: Salad
Enter the cooking time (in minutes): 5
Enter the ingredients (separated by commas): lettuce, tomato, cucumber, olive oil
```

## Part 2: `recipe_search.py`

### How to Use `recipe_search.py`

1. **Run the Script**: Start by running the script in your terminal:
    ```sh
    python recipe_search.py
    ```
2. **Enter the Filename**: You'll be prompted to enter the filename that contains your recipe data (e.g., `recipes.dat`).
3. **View Ingredients**: The script will display all available ingredients.
4. **Select an Ingredient**: Choose the number corresponding to the ingredient you want to search for.
5. **View Recipes**: The script will display all recipes containing the selected ingredient.

### Example Run
```
Enter the filename to search recipes: recipes.dat
Available ingredients:
0. pasta
1. tomato sauce
2. cheese
3. lettuce
4. tomato
5. cucumber
6. olive oil
Enter the number of the ingredient you want to search for: 0

Recipes containing 'pasta':

Recipe: Pasta
Cooking Time (min): 15
Ingredients: pasta, tomato sauce, cheese
Difficulty: Intermediate
```

## Deliverables

In this project, I have included the following files in my repository:
- `recipe_input.py`
- `recipe_search.py`
- The binary file generated by `recipe_input.py` (e.g., `recipes.dat`)
- Screenshots of each step during the execution of both scripts

## Screenshots

I have taken screenshots of the following steps:
1. Execution of `recipe_input.py`
2. Execution of `recipe_search.py`

These screenshots are named appropriately, such as "Part 1 Step 1," "Part 2 Step 2," etc., and uploaded to the repository.

## Submission

All the deliverables are uploaded to my GitHub repository.

Thank you for reviewing my project!
